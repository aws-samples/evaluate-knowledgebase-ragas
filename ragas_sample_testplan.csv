What is the AWS Well-Architected Framework used for?,"The AWS Well-Architected Framework provides a consistent approach to evaluating systems against architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable systems in the AWS cloud."
How can Amazon CloudWatch Synthetic Canaries and Amazon CloudWatch RUM be used with AWS X-Ray?,"Amazon CloudWatch Synthetic Canaries and Amazon CloudWatch RUM can be used with AWS X-Ray by instrumenting applications with AWS Distro for Open Telemetry and X-Ray or third-party collection agents to generate traces, and then using X-Ray tracing for Synthetic Canaries and RUM to analyze the request path from end users through downstream AWS infrastructure"
How can dashboards be used to communicate operational health?,"Dashboards can be used to communicate operational health by providing self-service access to metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) about the current operating status of systems and business. Dashboards can be tailored for different audiences like technical teams, leadership, and customers. This allows stakeholders to quickly obtain information on the current performance and health of operations without needing to contact operations teams."
What is the role of a benchmarking tool in the AWS Well-Architected Framework?,A benchmarking tool is used to quickly evaluate the performance of a workload and identify any bottlenecks or issues. Benchmark tests can be run earlier in the deployment process to provide faster feedback on performance compared to load tests. The results of benchmarking can be used to make architectural decisions and adjustments to optimize the workload performance.
What are the best practises mentioned in the AWS Well-Architected Framework for establishing a private CA hierarchy?,The AWS Well-Architected Framework recommends using AWS Certificate Manager Private CA (ACM Private CA) to establish a private CA hierarchy capable of issuing certificates for use with mutual TLS (mTLS). ACM Private CA can be used to securely share certificates across AWS accounts.
What role does automation play in implementing an effective vulnerability management program?,Automation is the key to continually scanning workloads for issues and unintended network exposure and performing remediation. Automating the creation and updating of resources saves time and reduces the risk of configuration errors creating further issues.
What are the different types of load balancers provided by AWS?,"AWS provides four types of load balancers: Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, Classic Load Balancer, and Gateway Load Balancer"
What is the emergency access process for gaining access to AWS accounts when the centralized identity provider is unavailable?,"The emergency access process relies on a pre-created emergency access AWS account that is used solely for emergency access and has AWS resources (such as IAM roles and IAM users) to support the emergency access process. During an emergency, an emergency administrator signs into the emergency access account using their password and MFA token code, switches to the emergency access IAM role in the emergency account, and finally switches to the emergency access IAM role in the workload account to perform the emergency change action."
How does AWS X-Ray help provide insights into a workload's performance?,"AWS X-Ray helps provide insights into a workload's performance by capturing trace data from a workload and its underlying components. This trace data includes information like request latencies, error rates, and throughput of the various services that comprise the workload. The trace data can then be analyzed in the X-Ray console to identify potential performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization."
What are the benefits of implementing microservices in AWS?,"Some benefits of implementing microservices in AWS include improved scalability, resilience, and flexibility. Microservices allow applications to scale independently, which enables scaling specific parts of an application individually based on demand. They also improve resilience by isolating failures and allowing redundant deployment of services. The loosely coupled design of microservices provides flexibility and freedom to develop and deploy updates independently."
